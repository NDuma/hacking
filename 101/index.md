## Overview

## The Hacker Ethic (what is a Hacker) ?

A summary which I cannot improve upon comes from Wikipedia [2]

>A hacker is someone who loves to program or who enjoys playful cleverness, or a combination of the two. [3] The act of engaging in activities (such as programming or other media [4]) in a spirit of playfulness and exploration is termed hacking. However the defining characteristic of a hacker is not the activities performed themselves (e.g. programming), but the manner in which it is done: Hacking entails some form of excellence, for example exploring the limits of what is possible, [5] thereby doing something exciting and meaningful.

Richard Stallman, the founder of the *Free Software* movement explains about hackers who program:

>What they had in common was mainly love of excellence and programming. They wanted to make their programs that they used be as good as they could. They also wanted to make them do neat things. They wanted to be able to do something in a more exciting way than anyone believed possible and show "Look how wonderful this is. I bet you didn't believe this could be done." [6]
    
## What a Hacker Is NOT!

Wikipedia continues:

>Hackers from this subculture tend to emphatically differentiate themselves from what they pejoratively call "crackers"; those who are generally referred to by media and members of the general public using the term "hacker", and whose primary focus — be it to malign or benevolent purposes — lies in exploiting weaknesses in computer security. [7]

## Hackers - Wizards of the Electronic Age

The hacker community began life - as many technology cultures did - in the United States of America; mainly in California and Massachusetts. By the 1980s it was a sub-culture being recognised outside of the technology world. In 1984 Fabrice Florin produced a documentary for Public Broadcasting Service (PBS - the U.S.A's poor cousin of the BBC) at the first *Hackers Conference* in California. This was a decade before the Internet became a common public communications system.

Many of the unknowns attending the conference have since become some of the most well-known and influential personalities of the information technology revolution. So, with apologies for the over-abundance of beards, please meet the unsung heros of the computer revolution.
