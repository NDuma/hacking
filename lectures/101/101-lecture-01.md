 * Wait for crackers to leave the lecture (have assistants take the names of leavers so they can be contacted privately to discuss their misguided notion of Hacking)
 
Now the wannabe Crackers have left us let's start again. Welcome to Hacking 101.

You're here because you want to become wizzards, and like Harry Potter, confound people with your magical powers. Because Hackers really are magicians in the eyes of the Muggles out there that don't know a USB port from a TCP port.

Eric S. Raymond (who we'll meet later) wrote: "Hackers built the Internet. Hackers made the Unix operating system what it is today. Hackers make the World Wide Web work. If you are part of this culture, if you have contributed to it and other people in it know who you are and call you a hacker, you're a hacker."

Stand up if want to be hacker!
